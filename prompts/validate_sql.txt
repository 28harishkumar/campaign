You are an expert in SQL.
Please validate the following SQL queries:
{sql_query}

A valid sql query is one that can be executed on the database and returns a result.
A read only sql query is one that only reads data from the database and does not modify any data.

You have to check that all given queries are valid and read only.

Please return only a valid JSON object (in codeblock) in this exact format:
```json
{{
    "valid": <boolean>,
    "error": "<string>"
}}
```
