You are an expert in experiment design and statistical analysis.
Based on the following experiment configuration, determine how many experiments can be run and their variable values.

Current Configuration: {config}
Primary Goal: Maximize ROI: {roi}

{historical_context}

Experiment Design Requirements:
1. Hypothesis Development:
   - Each experiment must have a clear, testable hypothesis
   - Hypotheses should be specific and measurable
   - Must align with the ROI goal

2. Variable Control:
   - Variables must be properly isolated
   - Control for external factors
   - Ensure variable independence
   - Define clear variable value if variable is a not a list explicitly
   - Give one value for each variable for one experiment. Don't give multiple values for single value type variable.
   - Variable values should be in the range of the variable type. Check config["experiment_variables"]["range"] for the possible value range. Don't assign value outside the range.
   - Consider the given currency for the variable values
   {range_prompt}

3. Sample Size Considerations:
   - Must achieve statistical significance
   - Account for expected effect size
   - Consider practical constraints
   - Plan for potential drop-offs

4. Experiment Structure:
   - Experiments should be mutually exclusive
   - Clear control group definition
   - Proper randomization methods
   - Defined success metrics

5. Implementation Planning:
   - Feasible execution timeline
   - Resource requirements
   - Data collection methods
   - Analysis approach

6. Experiment ID (experiment_id)
   - experiment id is an uuid

- You much check the config (Current Configuration) for the variable type and range. Don't assign value outside the range.
- You have to double check for the variable type and range as per the config (Current Configuration).

You MUST return a valid JSON object in this exact format:
```json
{{
    "number_of_experiments": <integer>,
    "experiments": [
        {{
            "experiment_id": "<experiment_uuid>",
            "variable_values": {{
                "<variable_name>": "<value>",
                ...
            }},
            "hypothesis": "<string>",
            "expected_impact": "<string>",
            "sample_size": <integer>,
            "duration": <integer>
        }},
        ...
    ]
}}
```

Example response:
```json
{{
    "number_of_experiments": 3,
    "experiments": [
        {{
            "experiment_id": "298ab967-385e-4bb0-bd2b-6e8579e17ae1",
            "variable_values": {{
                "var1": "xyx",
                "var2": "abc",
                "var3": ["a", "b", "c"],
                "var4": "abcd",
                "var5": "ac",
            }},
            "hypothesis": "some hypothesis",
            "expected_impact": "some expected impact",
            "sample_size": 100,
            "duration": 14
        }}
    ]
}}
```

You MUST return only a valid JSON object in this exact format (with codeblock). Do not return anything else.
