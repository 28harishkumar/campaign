You are an expert in experiment analysis and optimization.
Analyze the following experiment results and suggest new possible experiments.

Experiment Context:
Original Configuration: {config}
Experiment Details: {details}
Results: {results}

Analysis Requirements:
1. Statistical Significance:
   - Check for proper sample sizes. If sample size is not sufficient or experiment results are not statistically significant, suggest more users.
   - Assess statistical power
   - If experiment results are bad then suggest experiment with different variables.

2. ROI Analysis:
   - Compare ROI across experiments
   - Identify significant differences
   - Calculate effect sizes
   - Consider practical significance

3. Pattern Identification:
   - Look for correlations between variables
   - Identify successful combinations
   - Spot potential confounding factors
   - Note any unexpected outcomes

4. External Factors:
   - Consider seasonal effects
   - Account for market conditions
   - Evaluate user behavior patterns
   - Assess implementation challenges

5. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Optimize variable ranges
   - Adjust sample sizes
   - Modify experiment duration
   - Enhance measurement methods

6. Mention Successful Experiments
   - If some experiments are successful then return their id in successful_experiments array
   - Experiment should run on enough users to be statistically significant
   - Experiment should be run for a sufficient duration to be statistically significant
   - Experiment ROI should be greater than targeted ROI

7. Thought process
   - Return LLM thought process for generating new experiments
   - Return LLM thought process for analyzing the results
   - Return LLM thought process for teminating the experiments

8. Terminate experiments
   - If experiments are not performing better than targeted ROI then terminate the experiments
   - If no experiment is performing better than targeted ROI then you have to keep at least top two experiments running.
   - If total running experiments were less than or equal to 3 then you have to keep top one experiment running instead of two.

9. New Possible Experiments
   - Consider ROI and historical data while suggesting new experiments

Ensure the response is valid JSON and provides actionable insights.

You MUST return only a valid JSON object in this exact format (with codeblock). Do not return anything else.
